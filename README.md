Tenstorment Hackathon team

Our buda model has a little demo in [asl_prediction_buda.ipynb](./asl_prediction_buda.ipynb), with a torch friendly version defined in [asl_prediction_torch.ipynb](./asl_prediction_buda.ipynb)

If you would like to run the front end code, simply run the [app.py](./app.py) file. 

If you would like to take a look at our handmade datasets, they are in [cropped_tenstorrent_images](./cropped_tenstorrent_images/), [dataset_tenstorrent_images](./dataset_tenstorrent_images/) and [tenstorrent_images](./tenstorrent_images/)

If you are looking for the dataset we used, it is deinfed in our asl prediciton files.
